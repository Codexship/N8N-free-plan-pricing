# N8N Pricing Plan: Is N8N Free (cloud, enterprise self-hosted)

Ever wished you could automate half your business without dropping cash on expensive tools? I did too — [until I found N8N](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/free-automation). I signed up, built my first automation, and I was mind blown. Within days, I had a full-blown social media scheduler running, plus content workflows humming along for all three of my businesses. 

Everything’s on autopilot now — and I haven’t spent a dime. If you’re wondering what N8N’s free plan actually gives you (and when it makes sense to pay), this post breaks it all down — no fluff, just real talk.

## Is N8N Free?

<a href="https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/free-automation"><img width="1319" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-13 at 6 43 52 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75b5bf7e-67bf-46da-b4a4-a09bf6456984" /><a/>

Yes — [N8N is 100% free to get started](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/free-automation), and not just in a “limited trial” kind of way. They offer a **legit free plan** that lets you build powerful automations without reaching for your wallet.

But here’s where it gets interesting: N8N comes in two flavors — **N8N Cloud** (their hosted service) and **N8N Community Edition** (self-hosted). Both give you access to the same powerful automation builder, but the pricing works very differently.

If you choose the cloud free tier, you’ll get a set number of **workflow executions per month** (currently 200 on the free plan). It’s enough to build and test some light workflows — like scheduling posts or syncing Google Sheets. But if you want *unlimited* automations without restrictions, the **self-hosted version** is where N8N really shines. It’s totally free to run on your own server — yes, *forever free* — and gives you full control.

So to answer it straight:
**Is N8N free?** Yep. And if you’re willing to self-host, it’s one of the most powerful free automation platforms out there.

## N8N Free Plan: What You Get

The **N8N free plan** isn’t just a teaser — it’s surprisingly generous if you’re just getting started.

If you go with **N8N Cloud** , here’s what you get on the free tier:

* Up to **200 workflow executions per month**
* Access to the visual workflow builder
* A wide range of pre-built integrations (called "nodes")
* One active workflow at a time
* Community support via the forum

It’s perfect for testing ideas, building small automations, or creating a personal tool — like I did with my social media scheduler.

But here’s the cool part: if you’re open to **self-hosting** , the **[N8N Community Edition](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/free-automation)** gives you almost everything the paid plans offer — with *zero* execution limits. 

You can install it on a small VPS or even your laptop, and build as many workflows as you want. That’s where it becomes a serious **free alternative** to tools like Zapier or Make.

**So who’s this free plan ideal for?**

* Solo founders or freelancers
* Side-hustlers testing new systems
* Tech-savvy users who can self-host
* Anyone wanting full automation power without spending a dime

If you’re just starting out, the free plan is more than enough to blow your mind.

## What Is N8N? Quick Overview

Imagine if **Zapier** , **Make** , and a custom-coded backend had a baby — that’s **[N8N](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/free-automation)** .

It’s an open-source automation platform that lets you connect apps, move data, and run tasks automatically — all without writing a single line of code (unless you want to). The visual editor feels like Lego for workflows: drag, drop, and connect. Boom — automation.

But what sets N8N apart is flexibility. Unlike Zapier, which can be limiting unless you pay up, N8N gives you:

* **Conditional logic** (if/else, loops)
* **Unlimited nodes** in a workflow
* The power to **run custom JavaScript functions**
* And the freedom to **self-host everything**

Yep, it’s fully open-source — which means you can download it, run it on your own server, and never hit artificial usage limits. That’s a big deal if you’re building complex systems or running multiple automations for clients or businesses.

In short: **[N8N is like Zapier on steroids](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/free-automation)** — more power, more control, and way more affordable if you’re willing to roll up your sleeves.

## N8N Alternatives - N8N vs Other Automation Tools

Curious how N8N stacks up against other popular platforms? Here’s a straight-up comparison based on real-world usage, flexibility, and cost.

### 🔁 **N8N vs Zapier**

* **Ease of use** : Zapier wins for simplicity — it's super beginner-friendly.
* **Limits** : Zapier gets pricey fast since every tiny action counts. N8N gives you way more freedom, especially if you self-host.
* **Flexibility** : Zapier is no-code, but N8N supports full-on custom logic with code, loops, conditionals — way more powerful for builders.

### 🛠️ **N8N vs Make (Integromat)**

* **Visual experience** : Make is beautiful visually, but N8N gives you deeper control under the hood.
* **Pricing** : Both use consumption models, but with N8N you can go self-hosted and dodge the per-execution pricing entirely.
* **Flexibility** : N8N is more developer-friendly with the option to inject JavaScript logic directly into flows.

### 🤖 **N8N vs Dify**

* **Purpose** : Dify is built for AI workflows and LLM apps — think smart agents, not general automation.
* **How to use it** : If you’re building with AI (chatbots, RAG), Dify is your tool. If you need to connect tools, trigger actions, or orchestrate flows — that’s N8N’s zone.
* **Combo tip** : Many folks use Dify for the AI side, and N8N as the automation backbone.

### 🧰 **N8N vs Airflow**

* **Audience** : Airflow is built for data engineers and production-grade pipelines.
* **Complexity** : You’ll need to know Python, and setup isn’t for the faint-hearted.
* **Why N8N wins for most** : It’s easier to launch, manage, and scale — especially if you don’t live in the command line.

### 🧠 **N8N vs LangFlow**

* **Use case** : LangFlow is for designing AI chains visually — built specifically for working with LangChain and LLM logic.
* **Overlap** : LangFlow handles the brainy stuff. N8N is the glue that moves data and triggers those brains.

### 🔄 **N8N vs Power Automate**

* **Strength** : Deep Microsoft 365 and Azure integration. If your org runs on Microsoft, this tool fits like a glove.
* **Limitations** : You’ll pay per user and per flow. It’s rigid compared to N8N’s open structure.
* **Ideal use** : Go with Power Automate only if your stack is already locked into Microsoft.

## Quick Comparison Table

|Platform|Strengths|Best For|
| --- | --- | --- |
|**N8N**|Code-friendly, self-hosted, unlimited flows|Builders who want control & no limits|
|**Zapier**|Super easy, tons of integrations|Beginners & small automations|
|**Make**|Clean UI, conditional flows|Visual users doing mid-complexity work|
|**Dify**|AI-first workflows|Teams building LLM apps & agents|
|**Airflow**|Industrial-scale scheduling|Data engineers managing pipelines|
|**LangFlow**|Visual LLM chain builder|AI developers and LangChain builders|
|**Power Automate**|Tight MS integration|Corporate teams inside the Microsoft ecosystem|

## Self-Hosting: Stretching the Free Tier

Here’s the thing: [N8N’s free cloud plan is great to start with](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/free-automation), but if you really want to unlock its full power without paying monthly fees, **self-hosting** is the move.

### What does self-hosting N8N mean?

Instead of using [N8N’s cloud servers](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/free-automation), you install and run it on your own server — like a VPS from DigitalOcean, Hetzner, or even on your local machine or Raspberry Pi. That gives you **full control** over how many workflows you run, how often, and with zero execution limits.

### What you’ll need:

* A basic VPS (even a $5/month plan works)
* Docker (recommended for quick setup)
* Some light technical setup (a few terminal commands)

### Pros of self-hosting:

* **Unlimited workflows and executions**
* **No monthly N8N fees**
* Total data privacy and security
* You can install community nodes and beta features early

### Cons:

* You’re in charge of updates and maintenance
* You’ll need to manage uptime and backups
* Takes more time to set up than a hosted plan

### Real-life example:

I run N8N self-hosted for all three of my businesses. It powers everything from content scheduling to lead generation — and the cost? Just a $6/month VPS. That’s it.

So if you’re even a little bit technical (or willing to learn), self-hosting lets you run N8N like a pro without the pro price.

## N8N Cost Comparison: Cloud vs Self-Hosted vs Competitors

Let’s break down the real cost of running N8N compared to other automation platforms — so you can see where the best value really lies.

### 💸 N8N Cloud Pricing (Paid Plans)

* **Starter** : ~$24/month for 2,500 executions
* **Pro** : ~$60/month for 10,000 executions
* **Enterprise** : Custom pricing

Great for ease of use, but costs can add up if your automations grow fast.

### 🖥️ N8N Self-Hosted Pricing

* **Software** : Free — open-source forever
* **Server** : As low as $5–10/month
* **Executions** : Unlimited
* **Setup/Maintenance** : DIY (or use tools like Cloudron or Portainer to simplify)

If you're even a little technical, this is hands down the most cost-effective way to run serious automations.

### ⚔️ Competitor Pricing Snapshot

|Tool|Free Tier|Paid Plans Start At|Notes|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|**Zapier**|100 tasks/month|$19.99/month|Charges per action — scales fast|
|**Make**|1,000 ops/month|$10/month|Good visuals, but usage adds up|
|**Power Automate**|Limited, MS users only|$15/user/month|Best for MS-centric setups|
|**Pipedream**|Generous for devs|$19/month|Dev-focused, limited UI|
|**Dify**|Limited free LLM usage|Custom pricing|AI-focused, not general automation|

## The Bottom Line?

If you’re building *serious* , *high-volume* automations and don’t want to get nickel-and-dimed by execution limits, **self-hosted N8N is the best deal on the market** . And even N8N Cloud gives you more bang for your buck than most competitors — especially if you want code-level control.

## Tips to Maximize Your N8N Free Plan

Whether you’re on N8N Cloud’s free tier or just testing the waters, here are some smart ways to stretch every execution and get more done without upgrading:

### 1. **Use Triggers Wisely**

Avoid triggers that fire constantly. For example, instead of checking a Google Sheet every minute, schedule checks every few hours or use “webhooks” so N8N runs *only* when something changes.

### 2. **Batch Your Automations**

Group multiple tasks into one workflow. Instead of three separate automations posting to social media, build one smart flow that cycles through accounts — fewer executions, same results.

### 3. **Add Conditional Logic**

Add if/else logic to stop workflows from running when they don’t need to. For example, don’t send a Slack message if the status is already “Done.”

### 4. **Use Code Nodes for Heavy Lifting**

Instead of chaining 5 nodes to format data, use one JavaScript node. It saves steps (and execution time) while giving you more flexibility.

### 5. **Clean Up Logs & Limit Workflow History**

In the free cloud plan, older logs and executions can stack up. Set your workflows to keep minimal history — this lightens the load and speeds things up.

### 6. **Tap into the Community**

The N8N community is super active. You’ll find free templates, clever workflow ideas, and real humans sharing smart usage hacks. Don’t reinvent the wheel — borrow it.

## When to Upgrade Your N8N Plan – And How to Do It Smoothly

So you're loving N8N, workflows are humming… and then you hit a limit. Now what?

Here’s how to tell when it’s time to level up — and how to switch without stress.

### Signs It’s Time to Upgrade:

* **You keep hitting execution caps** : Your flows start failing or pausing due to usage limits — especially common on N8N Cloud free tier.
* **You need more than 1 active workflow** : The free cloud plan only allows one. If you’re juggling multiple automations, that’s a deal breaker.
* **You want team features** : Collaboration, shared projects, and role permissions kick in on the Pro tier.
* **Performance slows down** : High concurrency or data-heavy workflows may struggle on smaller plans.

### Upgrade Paths:

* **Cloud → Paid Cloud** : Easiest. Just pick a plan inside your N8N dashboard and scale up. Your workflows stay intact.
* **Cloud → Self-Hosted** : You’ll need to export your workflows, spin up your own server, and re-import them. It takes a bit more setup, but you’ll never look back once you feel the unlimited power.
* **Self-Hosted → Enterprise** : If you’ve been self-hosting and want SLA support, backups, SSO, or scale, you can move to an enterprise contract with hosted infrastructure.

### Tips for a Smooth Transition:

* Backup everything before making changes.
* Test migrated workflows in a staging environment.
* Monitor executions post-upgrade to make sure nothing breaks silently.
* Use tags or folders to organize workflows before scaling.

Whether you're growing into a paid plan or just leveling up your stack, upgrading N8N isn’t scary — and it’s often a sign you’re doing something right.
